### Presenter: Brendan O'Brien ([@formalfiction](https://twitter.com/formalfiction))

**Note:** This scheduled slot was originally "The Network is the Computer" by Jason Moiron, who unfortunately could not give his talk. Be sure to check out his projects on Github, especially https://github.com/jmoiron/sqlx. Thanks to Brendan for stepping up and filling in!

- Background: art director who was frustrated with engineers not adhering to mockups, learned coding and eventually Go after seeing Rob Pike say on Twitter, "you don't have to juggle inheritance trees."
- What perspectives do our tools ask us to take on a problem?
- Talk uses architecture as analogy, especially the traditional role of architects
  * _Note:_ there were some great examples and parallels in Brendan's talk that I unfortunately didn't capture. Here's hoping the recordings are available soon.
- Buckminster Fuller's original vision for SF was a giant pyramid (looks like the Louvre?)
- What does this have to do with programming? Learn from history! Peter Thiel recently proposed a city built on a floating island.
- The shape of an object-oriented program: tree of subclasses...
- 3 reactions to Go: That's it? I'm bored. I feel stupid.
  * Normally these are bad, but they're good here because Go makes the pyramid of doom go away.
- Programming is hard. Solving a problem is harder.
  * Solve real problems. Don't build Yelp for people!
- Make better compromises.
- Play nice with others.
